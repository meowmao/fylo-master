## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.

**To do this challenge you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

AUTHOR NOTES:
- used flexbox to layout
- set margins on many of the elements for the spacing. used margin-bottom. 
- there are many identical paddings and margins and I used variable to control it. However I wonder if this can be solved by having a class and append it instead?
